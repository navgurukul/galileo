## Our Git Workflow

### Main Branches
1. `master` is our holy grail. `master` and only `master` will ever be deployed to production environment.
2. `dev` is our playground (after we have perfected our code). `dev` will always be pushed to the staging environment.

### Workflow
1. All the development will take place in issue/feature specific branches. When starting a new branch, pull the new branch from master branch which will have the most stable code. You can do it from dev for the time being if the master is not upto date.
2. Create a pull request from the `issue specific branch` into `dev` which will be approved by someone who has the relevant access before being merged into dev.
3. After being merged into dev, we will deploy it to staging environment.

*We will make sure to have frequent merges from `dev` into `master` and release stuff into production*
